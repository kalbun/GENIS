"this is a special 'very limited edition' cd issued by focus features and released supposedly only to members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences (oscars) when voting for consideration of the oscar in 2005. it won the oscar for best achievement in music written for motion pictures. the cd contains all the beautiful gustavo santaolalla music used in the original motion picture. it does not contain any of the other music used in the motion picture, these tunes can be found in the general release original motion picture soundtrack - brokeback mountain cd. some wonderful music will be found here and nowhere else, the especially beautiful 'horse love' that is the music from the love scene generally known as 'second night in the tent' for instance, a long, 4-1/2 minute piece that backdrops ennis's awakening, leaving, and then returning to jack. for devoted fans of this music and this movie these pieces are indispensable.. . oddly enough, the twenty-two pieces are presented in a very bizarre sequence, seemingly unrelated to the movie in any way. it is easy enough however to download them and reconstruct them in the proper chronological sequence, or even something that makes more sense musically.. . listening to this music you can begin to understand the artistry that went into not only the music itself, but also ang lee's careful use of music in the film. such as the repeated use of certain musical themes during scenes of emotional change and evolution, horse love, flashback, jack deceased, and closet, all provide a haunting background score for these four life-changing scenes.. . expensive. no doubt. you might find it nowadays rarely on an online auction site, in 2006 they were regularly available there for between $70 and $200. if you're a devotee there is nowhere else to obtain this work.",8,"this is a special 'very limited edition' cd issued by focus features and released supposedly only to members of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences (oscars) when voting for consideration of the oscar in 2005. it won the oscar for best achievement in music written for motion pictures. the cd contains all the beautiful gustavo santaolalla music used in the original motion picture. it does not contain any of the other music used in the motion picture, these tunes can be found in the general release original motion picture soundtrack - brokeback mountain cd. some wonderful music will be found here and nowhere else, the especially beautiful 'horse love' that is the music from the love scene generally known as 'second night in the tent' for instance, a long, 4-1/2 minute piece that backdrops ennis's awakening, leaving, and then returning to jack. for devoted fans of this music and this movie these pieces are indispensable.

"a pretty solid compilation, ice candy contains tracks released from mid 2010 to mid 2014, with sunshine girl being the oldest track on the album and ice candy being recorded specifically for it. the track list mixes b-sides with big hits like sunshine girl, making up a pretty solid themed offering for the most part:. . 1. jewel. 2. love is everywhere. 3. sunshine girl. 4. chu chu. 5. summer time. 6. dreaming driving. 7. bon appetit. 8. emerald no oka (emerald hill). 9. love before we die. 10. ice candy. . jewel is a driving, upbeat (it's moumoon, duh ;p) track with synth and distorted guitar backing. it's one of moumoon's weaker tracks in my opinion, along the lines of some of their anime theme work.. . love is everywhere, sunshine girl, and chu chu are some of moumoon's most popular tracks, though none of them rate among my favorites.. . summer time (previously an exclusive to the hanabi (fireworks) single), dreaming driving, and bon appetit are solid additions to the fluffy summer love song theme of the album. bon appetit is one of my favorite moumoon songs, so i was glad to see it here.. . with emerald no oka, we get back to very recent songs that haven't had time to prove themselves. it's a good track, but not what i would have chosen to put on this compilation.. . love before we die breaks the upbeat flow completely. it has a very heavy, dramatic feel to it that just doesn't belong on this album. it's a decent song, but it just doesn't belong here.. . ice candy is a fully synthesized song that sounds more like a dance remix than an original moumoon track. i imagine it would be a lot of fun to see it performed live. again though, it just doesn't fit the theme of the compilation.. . the track list is mostly split between 2010 and 2014, with very little from the years in between (only love is everywhere, summer time, and bon appetit come from 2011-2013). i can think of several tracks from 15 doors, no night land, and pain killer (not to mention their earlier work) that would have worked extremely well with the theme, but the selection from love before we die is more puzzling than anything. replacing tracks 1, 8 and 9 with other 2014 songs like butterfly boyfriend, lovin' you, and memories would have made the album a stronger proposition. track 10 is fun and could be a nice feature if the theme were more cohesive.. . while it could have been better, this album covers most of the tracks that seem most popular with moumoon's average fan. it's a little hard to recommend against their regular studio albums, but it's perfect for those people who really just want sunshine girl and chu chu in the same place with some extras that are (mostly) along the same lines.",7,"a pretty solid compilation, ice candy contains tracks released from mid 2010 to mid 2014, with sunshine girl being the oldest track on the album and ice candy being recorded specifically for it. the track list mixes b-sides with big hits like sunshine girl, making up a pretty solid themed offering for the most part:

9. love before we die
10. ice candy

jewel is a driving, upbeat (it's moumoon, duh ;p) track with synth and distorted guitar backing. it's one of moumoon's weaker tracks in my opinion, along the lines of some of their anime theme work.

love is everywhere, sunshine girl, and chu chu are some of moumoon's most popular tracks, though none of them rate among my favorites.

summer time (previously an exclusive to the hanabi (fireworks) single), dreaming driving, and bon appetit are solid additions to the fluffy summer love song theme of the album. bon appetit is one of my favorite moumoon songs, so i was glad to see it here.

with emerald no oka, we get back to very recent songs that haven't had time to prove themselves. it's a good track, but not what i would have chosen to put on this compilation.

love before we die breaks the upbeat flow completely. it has a very heavy, dramatic feel to it that just doesn't belong on this album. it's a decent song, but it just doesn't belong here.

ice candy is a fully synthesized song that sounds more like a dance remix than an original moumoon track. i imagine it would be a lot of fun to see it performed live. again though, it just doesn't fit the theme of the compilation.

the track list is mostly split between 2010 and 2014, with very little from the years in between (only love is everywhere, summer time, and bon appetit come from 2011-2013). i can think of several tracks from 15 doors, no night land, and pain killer (not to mention their earlier work) that would have worked extremely well with the theme, but the selection from love before we die is more puzzling than anything. replacing tracks 1, 8 and 9 with other 2014 songs like butterfly boyfriend, lovin' you, and memories would have made the album a stronger proposition. track 10 is fun and could be a nice feature if the theme were more cohesive.

while it could have been better, this album covers most of the tracks that seem most popular with moumoon's average fan. it's a little hard to recommend against their regular studio albums, but it's perfect for those people who really just want sunshine girl and chu chu in the same place with some extras that are (mostly) along the same lines."
"incomprehensibly, until very recently, this 2001 release from the widely-circulated bernstein century edition was not listed on this website, although it was duly so on the european sister companies. for these works, one had to go to gould's complete beethoven piano concertos ([[asin:b0085mk2ki glenn gould plays beethoven: the 5 piano concertos]]) or, if one wanted the works individually, to the original jacket collection releases with their frustratingly scanty timings of 37 minutes each: [[asin:b000vfgscs beethoven: piano concerto no. 3 in c min]] and [[asin:b000vfgsdc beethoven: piano concerto no. 4 in g maj]].. . well then it is now repaired, although it remains to be seen if marketplace sellers will offer it at competitive prices, given that the two original jacket collection issues sell pretty cheap at the time of writing. from his complete traversal of beethoven's piano concertos, gould recorded three with bernstein: no.2 (april 1957, [[asin:b000uo7in8 beethoven: piano concerto no. 2 in b-flat major / bach: keyboard concerto no. 1 in d minor]]), 3 (may 1959) and 4 (march 1961). sony's bernstein edition seems wrong in crediting the new york philharmonic in piano concerto no. 3: the official bernstein discography attributes it (like the 2nd) to the columbia symphony orchestra, and in his discography of the new york philharmonic ([[asin:b003x0bqo8 new york philharmonic: the authorized recordings, 1917-2005]]) james h. north doesn't list it. why the columbia symphony orchestra in no. 2 and 3 rather than bersntein's new york phil, and why the change of conductors for no. 1 (golschmann, october 1958, [[asin:b000uh8hqc beethoven: piano concerto no. 1 in c ma]]) and no. 5 (stokowski american symphony orchestra, march 1966, [[asin:b000vfgsfa beethoven: emperor concerto]]), i don't know. an exchange of correspondance with north leads me to think (without being absolutely sure) that it is indeed the new york philharmonic, without its proper name for some obscure contractual reasons.. . anyway, this version of piano concerto no. 4 is exactly what you expect of gould: different from any other - and i am at this point making no pronouncement on its value. one of its distinctive features is the very spacious tempos adopted in all three movements - after barenboim-klemperer ([[asin:b000i2isl8 beethoven: piano concertos 1-5/choral fantasia - daniel barenboim, otto klemperer, new philharmonia orchestra & john alldis choir]]), the slowest i've heard among some 20 other recordings in the outer movements, and even significantly slower than barenboim-klemperer and even hansen-furtwängler ([[asin:b00007997l beethoven piano concertos 1 & 4]]) in the middle andante -, the effect in the first movement being sometwhat laid-back, if not lazy, a 'pastorale' on a sultry summer day, trudging at times, majestic also in the tutti. the other feature is the percussive clarity of gould's piano, making it almost brittle, together with its left-hand clarity, factoring back in some explosive dynamism which the slow tempos might have negated, and making it always interesting to hear, but also depriving the middle andante of some of its interiority (although some of that is factored back in by the very slow tempo). other than that, it is relatively free of gould's customary idiosyncracies, those you find in his 'emperor' with stokowski, like trills played not like trills but like sixteenth notes (e.g. very slow); the only ones are the slightly arpeggiated opening chords, and the usual suspect's usual humming. he plays beethoven's cadenzas. the sonics are superb and bersntein conducts with vigor, partly compensating for the slow tempos, with a superb and brisk final coda. the value judgement associated with those 'objective' factors is opened to each listener. i find it always interesting, and welcome as an alternative view.. . with all that, it is almost surprising how much gould's 3rd is devoid of his customary idiosyncrasies: the only ones i've spotted are a few slowly vibrating trills (but not as slow as on the emperor) and a few emendations in beethoven's first movement cadenza, most of which i find rather welcome: not the strange decision to omit the first two bars, but gould's playing p some of beethoven's f, his lisztian improvisation between 15:25 and 15:45 and the addition of the ensuing timpani rhythm at the left hand during the cadenza's final trills. even the famous humming is kept at a minimum. as in the 4th and 5th,  tempos are broad in all three movements,  but they are not drawn-out or sluggish (which was sometimes the impression left by the two others), and gould's crystalline, percussive touch and left-hand clarity are ideally suited to the composition. the middle largo is as restrained and touching as anyone's (and, incidentally, very close in its timing to bernstein's remake, with serkin, in 1964, as is the finale, [[asin:b0000029xe beethoven: piano concertos nos. 3 & 5 (bernstein century)]]). great support from bernstein, crisp and vigorous in the outer movements, heartfelt in the middle largo.. . still: like him or hate him, gould is unique and his beethoven, as infuriating as it may sometimes be, is always thought-provoking.. .

"wyatt's album 'novel and profane' could arguably be a reincarnation of some of the most talented artists of our time... with the exception that most of them are still living and you can hear their influences coursing through the veins of this brilliant work of power pop.  wyatt has assembled some of the finest hook-laden songs, polished them to perfection and bathed them in a pristine coating of sugar-coated sonic sweetness.  there is a vast array of musical stylings, each standing on their own, but interwoven with a golden thread of sunshine pop on steroids.  also recommended are wyatt's previous projects with his former bands, the pendletones & second saturday, both digitally re-released and expanded.. . happy listening!",9,"wyatt's album 'novel and profane' could arguably be a reincarnation of some of the most talented artists of our time... with the exception that most of them are still living and you can hear their influences coursing through the veins of this brilliant work of power pop.  wyatt has assembled some of the finest hook-laden songs, polished them to perfection and bathed them in a pristine coating of sugar-coated sonic sweetness.  there is a vast array of musical stylings, each standing on their own, but interwoven with a golden thread of sunshine pop on steroids.  also recommended are wyatt's previous projects with his former bands, the pendletones & second saturday, both digitally re-released and expanded.

"first off, i love jewel but this cd is really weird.  jewel was only 19 when this was recorded and maybe that part of the problem!  it contains some songs from her first album but also contains rarities (oddities) like 'god's gift to women', 'race car driver' and 'flower'.  the songs show some potential but you can see jewel wasn't fully formed yet.  her work would get so much better.  in fact, i've heard great live versions of 'race car driver' but this demo version is really out there.  i assume she was trying to be funny.  'flower' would have fit nicely on 'pieces of you' but 'god's gift to women' is not her style at all.  overall, not a good promo release to showcase the artist's potential.",7,"first off, i love jewel but this cd is really weird.  jewel was only 19 when this was recorded and maybe that part of the problem!  it contains some songs from her first album but also contains rarities (oddities) like 'god's gift to women', 'race car driver' and 'flower'.  the songs show some potential but you can see jewel wasn't fully formed yet.  her work would get so much better.  in fact, i've heard great live versions of 'race car driver' but this demo version is really out there.  i assume she was trying to be funny.

"i'd seen pictures of this cd once in awhile but knew very little about it until i ordered it. an obscure japanese only release from 1996 of mani and moebius plus engler. beat driven pulsing stuff energetic but very spacey. if you know moebius's solo works and like his tonspuren and blue moon and zero sets one and two. this takes that sound to an new level- very cool. 9 tracks recorded in 1996 in one take, the music sounds like it was composed really good if like strange beats!",8,"i'd seen pictures of this cd once in awhile but knew very little about it until i ordered it. an obscure japanese only release from 1996 of mani and moebius plus engler. beat driven pulsing stuff energetic but very spacey. if you know moebius's solo works and like his tonspuren and blue moon and zero sets one and two. this takes that sound to an new level- very cool. 9 tracks recorded in 1996 in one take, the music sounds like it was composed really good if like strange beats!"
