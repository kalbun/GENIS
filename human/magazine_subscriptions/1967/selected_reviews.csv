"we love magnifikid. it is not super cheap but well worth it if you have younger kiddos (of reading age). it's basically a missal with all the mass responses and readings of that sunday, plus little bonus items here and there (my favorite is ""this week's spotlight"", which basically goes in depth into a portion of the readings - keeping it at kid-level, of course -, but there are also craft projects, mazes, info about a particular saint or order, a comic strip, etc).. . i also love that they have a glossary of harder terms at the bottom of the page (ex. ""patriarchs"", ""homage"", what it means to ""fear"" the lord, etc). oh, and i like their weekly suggestions for morning and evening prayer, which are always simple and short.. . my kid has learned a lot, and i'm excited for kiddo #2 to start reading it when he's a bit further along reading-skills wise. also, to be honest, i'll always flip through it after sunday mass and sometimes i learn something, too!. . i highly recommend this to all catholic families who have kids age 6-10 or so. we will continue or subscription for years to come.",9,"we love magnifikid. it is not super cheap but well worth it if you have younger kiddos (of reading age). it's basically a missal with all the mass responses and readings of that sunday, plus little bonus items here and there (my favorite is &#34;this week's spotlight&#34;, which basically goes in depth into a portion of the readings - keeping it at kid-level, of course -, but there are also craft projects, mazes, info about a particular saint or order, a comic strip, etc).

"i used to love this magazine for their honest and impartial interviews, articles, and critiques.  times have changed. it's a big fan magazine. the most annoying thing is that i never, ever get my magazine on time. they have a 'must watch' section sunday through saturday for television (+ netflix. hulu, prime) shows that they reccomend. if i get the magazine before thursday, it's a miracle. i've complained to the company, and of course, they threw  the usps under the bus....funny, my other periodicals have no problem arriving on time. the magazine is just not what it used to be and they have no regard for customer service. its too bad, i used to look forward to my magazine arriving every week. every issue seems to increasingly disappoint me more and more every week. unless things drastically change, and they get better writers or rehire the writers they used to have, i will not be renewing my subscription after years of being a faithful reader.",4,"i used to love this magazine for their honest and impartial interviews, articles, and critiques.  times have changed. it's a big fan magazine. the most annoying thing is that i never, ever get my magazine on time. they have a 'must watch' section sunday through saturday for television (+ netflix. hulu, prime) shows that they reccomend. if i get the magazine before thursday, it's a miracle. i've complained to the company, and of course, they threw  the usps under the bus....funny, my other periodicals have no problem arriving on time. the magazine is just not what it used to be and they have no regard for customer service. its too bad, i used to look forward to my magazine arriving every week. every issue seems to increasingly disappoint me more and more every week. unless things drastically change, and they get better writers or rehire the writers they used to have, i will not be renewing my subscription after years of being a faithful reader."

i've been a subscriber and enthusiastic supporter for over 30 years. shining the spotlight on product quality is a worthy mission and they have decades of excellence behind them.

as of 2012, i felt cr had really lost its way. cr seems to be on the rebound, but some of my disappointments still hold true.

examples:

  - their mailings are as bogus as the companies they spotlight. misleading early renewal notices, 'important news' emails that are pure promos, sweepstakes nonsense, etc. i've received over 12 'last notice' offers for website access.

 - amazon reviews are often more useful. 50x the number of products covered and sometimes more detailed insight and data on each product. (other products really need lab testing. cr excels at that.)

 - website entrance fee is out of line. $19/year for magazine subscribers ($12 first year teaser).

 - iphone 4 was rated 'unacceptable' due to the antenna issue that many other phones also had, and was easily solved with a bumper or case (which 90% of people use anyway).

 - reliability survey methods: seriously flawed. if your vacuum dies after 3 years, there is no place in the survey for that info, because you replaced it of course. they only want to hear about your current vacuum, not the one you replaced 6 months ago.

 - auto reliability data is collected every year in early summer but full results are not published until 9 months later. the april auto issue is a tradition that makes no sense to me.

 - auto models come out in september, but the annual auto issue is in april. tradition!

 - the 'selling it' feature on the inside back-cover exposes typos and supposedly funny marketing mis-steps. please put this page out of its misery.

 - the annual buying guide, which gets thinner every year, is a rehash of prior articles. but it's *very handy* because it's also an index of articles. used to be an 8-year index. then a 4-year index. this year (2012) they eliminated the past-issue index! (using the free portion of the cr web site to find past magazine articles is not easy.)

summary:

consumer reports is a worthy cause. their general advice and lab tests can be really valuable, especially in certain product categories. their website is becoming quite impressive. consider subscribing to the cr site instead of the magazine (getting both is a steep $48/year).

"now we know why they were giving full year subscriptions away for free.  in print no less!!  this rag is no better than a cheap tabloid from the early 80's, long before the world had the internet to fuel it's absurd gossip and hollywood's unending, shallow self-promotion.  this wasn't even worth flipping through, just to look at the pictures.  we still thumb through every issue, for the occasional celebrity interview, which are usually just as disappointing as the rest of the printed skits.  but after only a couple months we already practically dread getting this in the mail every week, knowing it'll likely be a complete waste of time, if not an upsetting one, as this tabloid's approach to reporting on entertainment is most often as shallow and vainly self-promotional as the industry it's reporting on.  i guess in that respect it fits, but i remember a much better periodical when last we subscribed back in the 90's.  really disappointed how much this magazine has devolved.  you can easily find much more interesting, even far more current, entertainment news on the internet.  this is just another tool for corporate hollywood to promote it's current features, with commercial ideals shallowly masquerading as comical substance.",3,"now we know why they were giving full year subscriptions away for free.  in print no less!!  this rag is no better than a cheap tabloid from the early 80's, long before the world had the internet to fuel it's absurd gossip and hollywood's unending, shallow self-promotion.  this wasn't even worth flipping through, just to look at the pictures.  we still thumb through every issue, for the occasional celebrity interview, which are usually just as disappointing as the rest of the printed skits.  but after only a couple months we already practically dread getting this in the mail every week, knowing it'll likely be a complete waste of time, if not an upsetting one, as this tabloid's approach to reporting on entertainment is most often as shallow and vainly self-promotional as the industry it's reporting on.  i guess in that respect it fits, but i remember a much better periodical when last we subscribed back in the 90's.  really disappointed how much this magazine has devolved.  you can easily find much more interesting, even far more current, entertainment news on the internet.  this is just another tool for corporate hollywood to promote it's current features, with commercial ideals shallowly masquerading as comical substance."

i like it for the cartoons and i'm absolutely naive when it comes to politics, so i need this magazine to get some idea of what is going on.

with all the blogging and other nonsense, i feel secure that the new yorker does diligent fact checking before it prints something, so i rely on it where i won't rely on news printed on the internet.

"i am a chemical engineer and have fond memories of reading scientific american for many years.  it was written by experts in the field for people with scientific backgrounds but not necessarily in the specific topic.  today it is a platform for liberal leaning journalists.  its fine to have such a platform, but i wish they didn't destroy something i once loved.",6,"i am a chemical engineer and have fond memories of reading scientific american for many years.  it was written by experts in the field for people with scientific backgrounds but not necessarily in the specific topic.  today it is a platform for liberal leaning journalists.  its fine to have such a platform, but i wish they didn't destroy something i once loved."
