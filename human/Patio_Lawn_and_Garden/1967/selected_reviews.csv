1st day impression: of course it doesn't look anywhere close to the renderings on amazon listing. the material is not very thick. i was thinking something like grill cover but it's definitely thinner. it fits over the hot springs cover cradle rather tightly. the skirt could have been a few inches longer. didn't think it's necessary to clarify but there's been some geniuses out there using this cover instead of the actual insulating hot tub hard cover. this is just dust/water/uv shield. at least that's the expectation. i will update later to see how it performs and holds up.,5.5,1st day impression: of course it doesn’t look anywhere close to the renderings on amazon listing. the material is not very thick. i was thinking something like grill cover but it’s definitely thinner. it fits over the hot springs cover cradle rather tightly. the skirt could have been a few inches longer. didn’t think it’s necessary to clarify but there’s been some geniuses out there using this cover instead of the actual insulating hot tub hard cover. this is just dust/water/uv shield. at least that’s the expectation. i will update later to see how it performs and holds up.

"i purchased liba bbq gas grill cover 7107 in may of 2020 to replace one that was coming apart after several good years of use.  the replacement was of good quality.  it was constructed of what appeared to be a durable, lightly ""rubberized"" material.  it gave the perception that it would be fairly water resistant, and likely hold up to the elements for at least 18-24 months.. . several months later, my recently purchased replacement was destroyed by a hailstorm.  i purchased a new cover (the exact same model) to replace it.  the replacement that arrived was vastly different.  the material felt much lighter and thinner.  the ""rubberized"" feel was no more.  while the new material may have been just as good, it did not appear to be as water resistant.  overall, it felt much cheaper.. . i promptly returned the replacement, and again received a cover which was comparable to the one that had been destroyed.  to further my confusion, i noted that the informational sheet which accompanied the new cover was identical to the one i was returning with exception to the stated warranty period.  oddly, what i perceived to be the better quality cover has a 12 month warranty, while the ""lesser"" quality cover supposedly has a 36 month warranty.  while i can only surmise the reason for this, i would assume that it has less to do with the material type, and more to do with a general reduction in the warranty period of the product.  three years is a long time for any grill cover to withstand the elements without failing somewhere.. . bottom line:  this is a decent product.  both fit the grill very well.  the cover made of the ""better"" quality material seems comparable to an oem cover that i had many years ago (at 1/2 to 1/3 of the price).  that said, it seems that the cover you receive is a roll of the dice.",7,"i purchased liba bbq gas grill cover 7107 in may of 2020 to replace one that was coming apart after several good years of use.  the replacement was of good quality.  it was constructed of what appeared to be a durable, lightly “rubberized” material.  it gave the perception that it would be fairly water resistant, and likely hold up to the elements for at least 18-24 months.

"we've been working on our yard and looking forward to using the tiller. unpacking and assembly took about 15 minutes. started using it and, within 5 minutes, the wheel fell-off due to a lock washer that came loose. additionally, there was a missing flat washer. while minor, it was frustrating to stop and repair a brand new unit. i called customer service, left a call back number, and no one returned the call. on a positive note, it's a powerful lightweight tool which works well on slightly dampened soil. first impressions are lasting, so i couldn't give it a high rating. customer service will be the deciding factor in giving a higher rating on a future update.",5,"we've been working on our yard and looking forward to using the tiller. unpacking and assembly took about 15 minutes. started using it and, within 5 minutes, the wheel fell-off due to a lock washer that came loose. additionally, there was a missing flat washer. while minor, it was frustrating to stop and repair a brand new unit. i called customer service, left a call back number, and no one returned the call. on a positive note, it's a powerful lightweight tool which works well on slightly dampened soil. first impressions are lasting, so i couldn't give it a high rating. customer service will be the deciding factor in giving a higher rating on a future update."

"i was disappointed with this product. i received it as a gift for my sons. it seemed well made, but broke in less than 24 hours after the wind kicked up a bit one afternoon. (we're not talking a hurricane or anything). the joints in the wire frame underneath are plastic, and two of them broke. i tried to repair it but crazy glue doesn't seem to bond very well to this plastic. when i called the manufacturer, they offered to send me a new part...for $20 plus $5-10 shipping. that's nearly half the price of the whole product...just for one part! they told me it wasn't guaranteed to withstand anything more than a breeze and that i should take it in when i hear that it's going to be a windy day! i was appalled that a 'wind' toy has to be taken in, out of the wind. they could care less about my situation and actually laughed at me when i got mad. poor customer service. my kids loved it though while it lasted. just treat it gently and keep an eye on the weather! it's overpriced for what it is.",3,"i was disappointed with this product. i received it as a gift for my sons. it seemed well made, but broke in less than 24 hours after the wind kicked up a bit one afternoon.

"it's hard to get a good seal on the gilmour faucet hookup and so any small leak travels to the back of the unit and gets into the battery compartment where electronics also exist; basically the water leaked in and short circuited this device. i really would like my money back on this unit, and i would like to see them re-design the unit to not put the battery compartment in the back where any bit of water can seep into the unit and destroy it. at least create a better seal so that doesn't happen. i only used this one for a couple of weeks and then it died. i checked the battery compartment where i discovered water was present and the batteries were now corroding from all the water. new batteries did not restore its functionality as i also noticed i could see the electronics from the battery compartment where the water had seeped further. it's just a bad design as water and electronics don't mix. please create a better seal or put the battery compartment on the side maybe.",3,"it's hard to get a good seal on the gilmour faucet hookup and so any small leak travels to the back of the unit and gets into the battery compartment where electronics also exist; basically the water leaked in and short circuited this device. i really would like my money back on this unit, and i would like to see them re-design the unit to not put the battery compartment in the back where any bit of water can seep into the unit and destroy it. at least create a better seal so that doesn't happen. i only used this one for a couple of weeks and then it died. i checked the battery compartment where i discovered water was present and the batteries were now corroding from all the water. new batteries did not restore its functionality as i also noticed i could see the electronics from the battery compartment where the water had seeped further. it's just a bad design as water and electronics don't mix. please create a better seal or put the battery compartment on the side maybe."

"first  there are no instructions for assembling, though its not that difficult to figure out.. . at first i wasnt real impressed with this. its a bit of an art to use it. but once you get it down it works awesomely. this took about 85-90% of the dirt and grime off my wood deck and my concrete driveway/sidewalk. where i live( in the woods with very little grassy area amd pm a hill to boot)) dirt, algae and moss are a problem. the whole back of my house faces north and receives no direct sunlight until you get 10-15 feet from the house. prime places for algae and moss to grow. the previous owners i dont think ever power washed anything. my deck was green, my concrete almost black with dirt and grime.. . so i gave this a try and it works really well. the only thing i had problems with was deep rooted grime and pine  sap( on concrete) and moss on concrete. for these i had to use the wand. this doesnt spray at full pressure. it has two heads that spray at  maybe 800-1000 psi each. this prevents it from damaging your deck and concrete( 1600 psi will ""splinter"" wood and will eat into concrete making it rough and gritty). but this does take most dirt and grime off flat surfaces. if you use it regularly ( once a year) you should have to use the wand very little if at all.. . so some tricks to this little contraption. first the bristles on it... those arent for ""brushing"" and scrubbing"" those are to slow water flow and let water gently run out from under it. if you try to scrub with this its going to do all kinds of weird things( and you will like spray you and everything else around you). what you instead want to do is treat it like a ""hovercraft"" you want it to hover on the jets of water. this allows it to float over the surface. you want to go slowly side to side. the dirtier your surface is the slower you want to go or it will leave ""artwork"". its not a fast attachment. you have to have patience with it and use it slowly. but the 60%-80% faster claim made by the company(???) is correct. with the wand on 3/4 pressure i was doing 20 sq ft in about 10 minutes( 4x5 ft pad), with this i was doing it in about 3 minutes.. . one last note is that you may have to spray down the area you wash with the wand( wide spray about car wash pressure) to get the loose dirt off the surface afterwords. since the bristles slow the water flow to a gentle stream dirt can be redeposited on the surface( mostly  in the case of concrete). a quick spray with the wand on a low pressure fan setting will take this dirt right off...or even a garden hose will take it off.",8.5,"first  there are no instructions for assembling, though its not that difficult to figure out.
