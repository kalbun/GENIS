"this is the first valved diatonic harmonica i've purchased. it's solid and well-made like the conventional promaster harmonicas. the valves make blow bends a bit easier, but don't seem to have much effect on draw bends. the valves on the lower notes also tend to buzz while playing. apparently this is a typical problem with all valved harps. for my playing habits i'll probably stick with the non-valved harps from now on.",4.5,"this is the first valved diatonic harmonica i've purchased. it's solid and well-made like the conventional promaster harmonicas. the valves make blow bends a bit easier, but don't seem to have much effect on draw bends. the valves on the lower notes also tend to buzz while playing. apparently this is a typical problem with all valved harps. for my playing habits i'll probably stick with the non-valved harps from now on."

just got this tube today (i'll re-post down the road to talk about durability). so far i'm amazed with the improvement over the stock tube that came with the audio bravo v2. i've put plenty of time burning in the stock tube with still muddled details and an over-brightness in sound signature. plugged this guy in and let it warm up for a  couple hours. i'm instantly pleased with this purchased.,7.5,just got this tube today (i'll re-post down the road to talk about durability). so far i'm amazed with the improvement over the stock tube that came with the audio bravo v2. i've put plenty of time burning in the stock tube with still muddled details and an over-brightness in sound signature. plugged this guy in and let it warm up for a  couple hours. i'm instantly pleased with this purchased.

"the color is more attractive than it looks on the internet and the flying saucer shape is just ok. the sound is fine with two options, one that sort of sounds like the old woodblock sound of a clockwork mechanism and a higher pitched one. my main complaint is that it so unergonomic compared to a traditional metronome which had just a simple sliding weight on a pendulum. all the controls are on the bottom molded in black plastic. the settings that are not just molded into the plastic are in dark orange. impossible to change a setting unless you pick it up and carry it to within a foot or two of a bright lamp. no design attention there at all. probably would not buy it again because of that.",6.5,"the color is more attractive than it looks on the internet and the flying saucer shape is just ok. the sound is fine with two options, one that sort of sounds like the old woodblock sound of a clockwork mechanism and a higher pitched one. my main complaint is that it so unergonomic compared to a traditional metronome which had just a simple sliding weight on a pendulum. all the controls are on the bottom molded in black plastic. the settings that are not just molded into the plastic are in dark orange. impossible to change a setting unless you pick it up and carry it to within a foot or two of a bright lamp. no design attention there at all. probably would not buy it again because of that."

the quality of the string used seems slightly lower grade and i'm worried about weathering. but the design and finish is otherwise cute. the quality of the chime sound is decent—though i've heard better. a note of clarity: the für elise feature is just silkscreened musical bars/notation on one side of the white row of chimes. the chime isn't actually tuned to sound like beethoven's für elise.,5.5,the quality of the string used seems slightly lower grade and i'm worried about weathering. but the design and finish is otherwise cute. the quality of the chime sound is decent—though i've heard better. a note of clarity: the f&uuml;r elise feature is just silkscreened musical bars/notation on one side of the white row of chimes. the chime isn't actually tuned to sound like beethoven's f&uuml;r elise.

"work great for setting pedals up next to eachother. i read up on their advanced soldering process  (with a silver solder blend and high heat soldering to make the joints stronger) and that was what made me decide to try these out. i noticed a lot more clarity when switching to these from monster cables on my board. just be gentle with the connections. although none of mine have broken or become loose (connections are very solid), using the 4 inch cables puts more strain on the ends than i would prefer. i'd recommend going with at least the 5 or 6 inch option from world's best cables. using the 4 inch cables also made me have to put a couple of my pedals in funky positions. i will probably end up ordering a few 6 inches to clean things up. still a fantastic option for the price compared to other mogami cables. unless they start falling apart, i would buy them again. i ordered 3 different types and all the cables were shipped in perfect working condition.",7,"work great for setting pedals up next to eachother. i read up on their advanced soldering process  (with a silver solder blend and high heat soldering to make the joints stronger) and that was what made me decide to try these out. i noticed a lot more clarity when switching to these from monster cables on my board. just be gentle with the connections. although none of mine have broken or become loose (connections are very solid), using the 4 inch cables puts more strain on the ends than i would prefer. i'd recommend going with at least the 5 or 6 inch option from world's best cables. using the 4 inch cables also made me have to put a couple of my pedals in funky positions. i will probably end up ordering a few 6 inches to clean things up. still a fantastic option for the price compared to other mogami cables. unless they start falling apart, i would buy them again. i ordered 3 different types and all the cables were shipped in perfect working condition."

1)  strong interference when being plugged into zoom l-8 mixer, with supplied trs to xlr adapter.

the mid frequency humming was evident throughout all input/outputs and r2 receiver,  this can render electronic guitars unusable, and very annoying noise for iem purpose.
all close by cables can be interfered, your can check this by moving around  cables around u2 transmitter.

2) marginally acceptable interference when being plugged into zoom l-8 xlr output (w/o supplied trs adapter)

3) extend the transmitter via an extension cable (trs /xlr)  away from signal cable and mixer can cure this issue

a 30 cm extension wire can cure the issue, deliver clear sound.

the interference is somewhat due to the interoperability between a all-plastic shielded zoom l-8 mixer.

"the aqua puss is a really 'raw' delay effect that i think is decent quality for the price, but i feel that the controls on it really limit its practical use.  if you are looking for a delay that you won't have to change during the middle of a performance, this will do the job well (it does not have tap tempo, which some folks like - i find that it gets in my way).  throw this effect on top of a slow lead to crank up a really spacey vibe (think gilmour) - it does a really good job at that, just be sure to bring your own reverb to even out the repeats.  dial the delay down but crank the blend to add some extra texture to your playing - it does a really good job at doubling to thicken up those power chords a bit.. . i did my due diligence playing with this effect in different spots in my rig, both in and out of my amp's effects loop, but i just could not get the sound i wanted to out of it.  it sounded much better in the fx loop and i was finally able to get closer to what i was going for, though i still just couldn't seem to dial in that sweet spot.  in the end i found the effect to sound too choppy and overly dramatic for my taste; i want a delay that is a lot more subtle to accent only certain parts of my playing, and i found with this pedal that it's either inaudibly short or too thick and long for what i want.. . i bought mine used to try it out and it will go back on the used market fairly soon.  before i got this, i thought all delays are more or less the same.  i definitely don't think that anymore and i'll be spending a bit of time in a music shop trying a few different delays before i spend money on another one.",5.5,"the aqua puss is a really 'raw' delay effect that i think is decent quality for the price, but i feel that the controls on it really limit its practical use.  if you are looking for a delay that you won't have to change during the middle of a performance, this will do the job well (it does not have tap tempo, which some folks like - i find that it gets in my way).  throw this effect on top of a slow lead to crank up a really spacey vibe (think gilmour) - it does a really good job at that, just be sure to bring your own reverb to even out the repeats.  dial the delay down but crank the blend to add some extra texture to your playing - it does a really good job at doubling to thicken up those power chords a bit.

"this guitar is one of my main two, alongside my les paul. i got it secondhand off of craigslist in near perfect condition for a steal, it was easily one of the best $200 i've ever spent. the neck is smaller and faster than my les paul, and the action is lower, making it fantastic for playing metal solos and fast licks. the floating tremolo is very stable, and doesn't lose tuning at all, even after heavy use it stays perfectly in tune.. . this is a fantastic guitar for someone looking for a great, fast playing guitar, with ibanez craftsmanship and style, but without the hefty price tag that comes along with higher models.",8.5,"this guitar is one of my main two, alongside my les paul. i got it secondhand off of craigslist in near perfect condition for a steal, it was easily one of the best $200 i've ever spent. the neck is smaller and faster than my les paul, and the action is lower, making it fantastic for playing metal solos and fast licks. the floating tremolo is very stable, and doesn't lose tuning at all, even after heavy use it stays perfectly in tune.
